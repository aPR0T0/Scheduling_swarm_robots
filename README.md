# Scheduling algorithm for the swarm robotics applications

Discovering an optimal generalized algorithm to perform a larger process made up of very smaller subtasks

## Objective of the research

There are multiple ways in which various CPUs and Microprocessors schedule the processes in-order to make the processes smooth and utilise least possible resources for the tasks. Some of the most interesting algorithms used in the CPUs are First come first serve, Multilevel queue scheduling, Round Robin Scheduling, least run time scheduling, and many more. There can be multiple ways of handling a process by the CPU but the question is when to handle and execute the process. Similar problem is faced in Industrial robotics to utilise the resources in best possible manner so that a process is never stopped and the tasks are evenly distributed, current work mostly focuses on a single type of bot which is best in performing a single type of task and dedicate it and it's counterparts to a single task. But what if there is a group of multiple types of bots in which each bot can perform multiple tasks (but one task at a time) but taking different levels of work to perform the task. So, we set to discover answer for the same.

## Sub-optimal implementations  

Here are the some algorithms that we scheduled for the robots

- First come first served (Ultra simplistic approach)
```cpp
// Inputs given here
```
Why can't we use this?

- Round Robin Scheduling
```cpp
// Inputs given here
```
Why can't we use this?
- Multi-level queue Scheduling
```cpp
// Inputs given here
```
Why can't we use this?
